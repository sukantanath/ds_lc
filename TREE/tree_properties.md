Tree can be though of as a DAG with N nodes and N-1 edges.
Binary Tree has at most 2 children nodes.
Tree traversal:-
1. Pre-order: traverse root first , then left & then right subtree.
2. In-order: traverse left subtree first, then root & then right subtree.In order gives all data in sorted manner in BST(binary search tree).
3. Post-order: traverse left subtree first, then right subtree and at last root. Deletion happens in post-order. Also , if a mathematical equation is expressed
